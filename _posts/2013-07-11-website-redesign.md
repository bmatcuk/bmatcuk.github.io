As you might have noticed, I redesigned my website! Yay! It's only been *10 years* since my last update...

I've moved my site hosting over to [github pages](http://pages.github.com/ "github pages") and I'm really impressed with how easy it was to setup! You can even use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyll") to generate a blog-style site. All you do is push the code to a special repository and github will run it through jekyll. Nice!

Anyway, we'll see if I can manage to keep these pages updated. I'm hoping to use this site to showcase my github projects and their documentation... but I'll probably just get lazy again.

If you're using IE and this site looks wonky, I suggest upgrading to ANY OTHER BROWSER. Welcome to the 21st century. I don't have the time to make sure this site works in that giant pile of crap...
