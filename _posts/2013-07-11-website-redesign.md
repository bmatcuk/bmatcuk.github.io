As you might have noticed, I redesigned my website! Yay! It's only been *10 years* since my last update...

I've moved my site hosting over to [github pages](http://pages.github.com/ "github pages") and I'm really impressed with how easy it was to setup! You can even use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyll") to generate a blog-style site. All you do is push the code to a special repository and github will run it through jekyll. Nice!

Anyway, we'll see if I can manage to keep these pages updated. I'm hoping to use this site to showcase my github projects and their documentation... but I'll probably just get lazy again.

PS: No attempt has been made to make this website work in IE - I don't have time for that. If you're using IE, it's time for you to upgrade to something else anyway.
